Spring Android
================================

1.0.0.M1 (2010.11.18)

New Features
* Commons-Logging facade for Android allows libraries using commons-logging to log to Android's native log.
  The logging levels specified for Commons Logging can be almost directly mapped to the levels that exist in the Google Android platform.
  The following list shows the mapping implemented by this logger:

  - JCL TRACE to Android VERBOSE
  - JCL DEBUG to Android DEBUG
  - JCL INFO to Android INFO
  - JCL WARN to Android WARN
  - JCL ERROR to Android ERROR
  - JCL FATAL to Android ERROR	  

* RestTemplate support in Android. You can now utilize RestTemplate calls in Android projects using the CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory.
  Due to known issues with Android's java.net.HttpURLConnection implementation, we recommend avoiding using SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory at this time.
